        Headline: Kitten Caught in Bank Robbery Tells All: “I Had to Close My
        Eyes So I Wouldn’t Faint”
      </h1>

      <p>
        <em>Pawsville, April 29</em> — In a bizarre turn of events this morning,
        a small kitten named Milo found himself trapped inside the First Feline
        Bank during a robbery carried out by a gruff, masked dog wielding a
        banana like a weapon. Milo, a five-month-old tabby with a fondness for
        milk and nap-time, was at the bank with his owner to open his first
        savings account. Moments after stepping up to the counter, the doors
        slammed shut and the barking began. “I heard this loud growl and turned
        around,” said Milo, still visibly shaken but wrapped in a comforting
        blanket. “This huge dog in a trench coat shouted for everyone to put
        their hands up. I was so scared, I had to close my eyes just so I
        wouldn’t faint.” According to eyewitnesses, the dog — identified only as
        “Ruff Jack” — demanded all the tuna bond certificates and a bag of chew
        toys before fleeing the scene in a suspiciously squeaky getaway vehicle.
        Fortunately, no one was harmed. Ruff Jack reportedly slipped on a puddle
        of spilled milk outside the bank, dropping most of the loot. Detective
        Badger, the hard-nosed veteran leading the case, gave a brief statement
        outside the Pawsville precinct:

          >“We’ve been tracking Ruff Jack for months. This ain’t his first time
          going after high-value snacks. He’s messy, loud, and always leaves a
          trail of fur. But trying to intimidate a kitten? That’s a new low.
          Rest assured, we’ll sniff him out.”</em

        Police have increased patrols in local parks and hydrant-heavy areas.
        Milo, meanwhile, has been hailed as a “tiny hero” for staying calm under
        pressure — even if it meant squeezing his eyes shut and pretending it
        was all a bad dream.
